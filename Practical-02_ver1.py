Problem 4 : Write a program in python to calculate the interest bank should charge for various EMI options. If the user chooses to EMI plan for 3 month then bank should charge interest @5% per month .if he choose EMI plan for 6 months then Rate will be 10% per month and if he chooses EMI plan for 12 month then the rate will be 15% per month . use the formula I=(P*R*T)/100 to calculate the interest and then claculate the total amount he will be charged at the end of his Plan . take input P principal amount that is the amount he wants to pay in EMI .R as the rate which bank chares and T as the month plan . take T in year not in month . T = month/12.
